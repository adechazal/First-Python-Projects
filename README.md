# First-Python-Projects
Mini-projects I started in order to learn data analytics concepts using Python. The include "Exploring my grocery bills at Migros", "Exploring my running times in the ZugerTrophy (Zug's community run challenge)", "Exploring a photo using Numpy", and "Exploring my Marathon Training data from Strava".
